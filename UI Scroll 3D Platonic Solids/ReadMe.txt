Thanks for installing the asset!

Briefly about the purpose of each script:
- Bubble			(describes the behavior of a soap bubble)
- Scroll			(controls scrolling and color setting)
- SpawnBubbles		(responsible for spawning bubbles in the background of the scene)

All blocks in scripts are commented out, so I think there will be no problems. Otherwise, write to the mail isleofassets@gmail.com
